# TITLE
# SHORTEST PATH PLANNER GIVEN INPUT AT, PREDEFINED MAP AND COST FUNCTION (distance, #turns)

# DESCRIPTION
# This script is called by and takes input from localization_node and calculates the shortest path (in our predefined map) based on Dijkstra's Algorithm
# It incorporates basic traffic rules, s.a. lane direction, no U-turns (see user scenario description of demo_map)
# It also takes into account the distances AND the number of turns between nodes (AT's) as weights/scaled costs for the SSP problem.s
# Output is a string of nodes (AT's) that the DB has to follow in order to get to the desired end point via the shortest path.

# TODO:
# Convert this to DTROS class based script, in order to use ros logging services
